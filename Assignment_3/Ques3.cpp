/* Q3. Write a class to find volume of a 
Cylinder by using following members. (volume of
Cylinder=3.14 * radius * radius *height) 
(write a menu driven code for it and also use modular
approach)
Class having following member functions:
Cylinder()
Cylinder(double radius, double height)
getRadius()
setRadius()
getHeight()
setHeight()
getVolume()
printVolume()
Initialize members using constructor member 
initializer list. */
